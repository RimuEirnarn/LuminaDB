**LuminaDB** (previously known as SQLite Database) is a lightweight, developer-friendly wrapper for SQLite designed to feel as intuitive as Laravel's Eloquent ORM, but in Python.

> [!WARNING]
> ‚ö†Ô∏è This library is still pre-1.0, which means it's not optimized for high performance or low memory usage (yet). Use with care. If you run into serious issues, feel free to open an issue, we‚Äôre listening.

## üöÄ Usage & Demo

Curious how it works in action?  
Check out the live example here: [luminadb demo](https://github.com/RimuEirnarn/LuminaDB_demo)

---

## üì¶ Installation

The library is available via PyPI:

```sh
pip install luminadb
```

Prefer to install directly from GitHub? You can still do this the old-school way:

```sh
pip install https://github.com/RimuEirnarn/LuminaDB/archive/refs/tags/<latest-version>.zip
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

Thanks for considering contributing to LuminaDB! Here's what you'll need:

- **Testing**: `pytest`
- **Linting**: `pylint`
- **Docs**: `sphinx`

Dependencies are split between:
- `dev-requirements.txt` (core development)
- `docs-requirements.txt` (documentation)

To get started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/RimuEirnarn/luminadb
cd luminadb

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

pip install -r ./dev-requirements.txt
./bin/check.sh
```

The `check.sh` script will run:

```sh
pylint --rcfile ./dev-config/pylint.toml luminadb
pytest --config-file ./dev-config/pytest.ini
```

Simple and clean.

## Short note

Either you can call this project: Library, ORM, ORM-lite, or driver is up to you. This is a high-level abstraction built on top of standard sqlite3.
